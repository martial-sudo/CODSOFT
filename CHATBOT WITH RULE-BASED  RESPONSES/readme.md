This project is a simple rule-based chatbot that responds to user inputs using predefined rules instead of AI or machine learning models. It matches keywords or patterns in the user's messages and returns appropriate responses, making it easy to customize, understand, and control. Ideal for basic customer support, FAQs, or educational bots, it runs quickly and is lightweight. You can easily extend the rules by editing a single function in the code, and the project is beginner-friendly, requiring only Python to get started.
