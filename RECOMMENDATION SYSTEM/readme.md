This project implements a film recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques to suggest similar movies based on user ratings. By analyzing patterns in the MovieLens dataset, the system leverages k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to identify and recommend movies that are likely to match a user's preferences. It includes data exploration, sparse matrix creation, and similarity searches, providing personalized recommendations to help users discover new films they might enjoy. This project demonstrates practical machine learning and data science skills in building a real-world recommender system.
