This project is an intelligent Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Python, featuring an AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves and ensure challenging gameplay. The AI is designed to never lose, making it a great way to practice strategic thinking and improve your own skills. The game offers an interactive console interface, clear logic for move validation and game state evaluation, and serves as a hands-on example of implementing classic game theory in Python. Perfect for learning about algorithms, AI decision-making, and game development basics.
